# Range-Finder-Using-Arduino

## Description
Using the Ultrasonic Sensor, Arduino UNO, LCD display, and power supply module, I coded a program that would allow for the ultrasonic sensor to send data on how far away something is from in front of it.

## Tasks
- Build a way to read the distance from any object using an Arduino UNO, LCD screen, and Ultrasonic Sensor
- Program the device to send out a pulse from the sensor, wait, then read in the incoming pulse after rebounding off of the object and calculate the distance based on the wait time
- Make the design clean, and easily modifiable
